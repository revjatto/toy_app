Git initialisation

git init
git status

To tell Git we want to keep the changes, we use the commit command:

git commit -m "Initialize repository"

By the way, we can see a list of the commit messages using the log command:

$ git log

We see here that a file has been deleted, but the changes are only on the “working tree”; they haven’t been committed yet. This means we can still undo the changes using the checkout command with the -f flag to force overwriting the current changes:

$ git checkout -f
$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
$ ls app/controllers/
application_controller.rb  concerns/
